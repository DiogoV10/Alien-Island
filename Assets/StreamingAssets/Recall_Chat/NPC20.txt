I will tell you a secret, it´s not what you think<br>We had an agreement whit them<br>we had to sacrifice people.
They were experimenting on us, inbreeding with us<br>trying to make us strong, a better race.
All of that for nothing, we didn´t get minerals<br>some people say that because they choose<br>not to believe the truth.
All for a better future they said.
What a joke!
